# Message queues

## What we will cover

- What is a message queue?
- What are their use case?
- An example use case

## Notes

Message queues are a storage system where we can publish a message to a temporary storage service, you can
almost think of them as a small database for message that will be published to other services who want to
know when something has happened.

A great example is that something has happened in a MicroService architecture and you want other services to
know that it happened so they can act on this information.
